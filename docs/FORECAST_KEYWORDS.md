## City-Specific Glossary

The NWS Discussion widget includes a **Glossary tab** in the expanded modal view that provides city-specific definitions for locations and weather phenomena.

### Glossary Features
- **City-specific content**: Each NWS office (LOX, LOT, OKX, BOU, EWX, MFL) has its own glossary
- **"In discussion" badges**: Terms that appear in the current forecast discussion are marked
- **Three categories**:
  - **Locations** (emerald): Geographic features and place names
  - **Weather Phenomena** (teal): Regional weather patterns
  - **Technical Terms** (purple): Specialized meteorological terminology

### Data Source
Glossary definitions are stored in `src/data/cityGlossaries.js`, organized by NWS office code.

### Adding Glossary Terms
1. Identify the NWS office code for the city
2. Add the term to the appropriate category in `src/data/cityGlossaries.js`
3. Provide a clear, concise definition (1-2 sentences)
4. The term will automatically appear in the Glossary tab and show "in discussion" if found

## Adding New Keywords

When adding keywords:
1. Identify the term in an NWS discussion
2. Determine the appropriate category
3. Add to **both** widget files:
   - `src/components/widgets/ForecastDiscussion.jsx` (compact widget)
   - `src/components/weather/NWSDiscussionWidget.jsx` (expanded modal view)
4. Update this documentation with the keyword and definition
5. Note if city-specific
