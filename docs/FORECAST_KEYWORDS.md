## Adding New Keywords

When adding keywords:
1. Identify the term in an NWS discussion
2. Determine the appropriate category
3. Add to **both** widget files:
   - `src/components/widgets/ForecastDiscussion.jsx` (compact widget)
   - `src/components/weather/NWSDiscussionWidget.jsx` (expanded modal view)
4. Update this documentation with the keyword and definition
5. Note if city-specific
