## City-Specific Glossary

The NWS Discussion widget includes a **Glossary tab** in the expanded modal view that provides city-specific definitions for locations and weather phenomena.

### Glossary Features
- **City-specific content**: Each NWS office (LOX, LOT, OKX, BOU, EWX, MFL) has its own glossary
- **"In discussion" badges**: Terms that appear in the current forecast discussion are marked
- **Three categories**:
  - **Locations** (emerald): Geographic features and place names
  - **Weather Phenomena** (teal): Regional weather patterns
  - **Technical Terms** (purple): Specialized meteorological terminology

### Data Source
Glossary definitions are stored in `src/data/cityGlossaries.js`, organized by NWS office code.

### Adding Glossary Terms
1. Identify the NWS office code for the city
2. Add the term to the appropriate category in `src/data/cityGlossaries.js`
3. Provide a clear, concise definition (1-2 sentences)
4. The term will automatically appear in the Glossary tab and show "in discussion" if found

---

## Adding New Keywords

When adding keywords:
1. Identify the term in an NWS discussion
2. Determine the appropriate category
3. Add to **both** widget files:
   - `src/components/widgets/ForecastDiscussion.jsx` (compact widget)
   - `src/components/weather/NWSDiscussionWidget.jsx` (expanded modal view)
4. Update this documentation with the keyword and definition
5. Note if city-specific

**Note**: This widget uses a curated subset of terms that frequently appear in Area Forecast Discussions (AFDs). Not all NWS glossary terms are included—only those commonly used by forecasters in daily discussions and relevant for prediction market traders. The keyword list is continuously refined based on analysis of real AFDs from multiple NWS offices.
